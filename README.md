# PUI2018_yc1786

Process 

The HW1_yc1786 folder was created on terminal then commited and pushed to the system. Before pushing the folder to git repo, I dragged the 01.png and 02.png which are screenshots from homework last week.

For the fork part, I collaborated with Haopeng Huang nad Pengzi Li.
