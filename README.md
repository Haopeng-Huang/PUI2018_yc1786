# PUI2018_yc1786

Process 

The HW1_yc1786 folder was created on terminal then commited and pushed to the system. Before pushing the folder to git repo, I dragged the 01.png and 02.png which are screenshots from homework last week.

For the fork part, I collaborated with Haopeng Huang nad Pengzi Li.

For HW3_yc1786, I choose Cause of Deaths in open data.

For HW4_yc1786,I split three assignments in different notebook files. For assginment 1, I did extra credit part for Gaussian fitting. Also, I am confused about how to describe the plot in a more professional way. For assignment 2, my hypothesis is that male bikers tend to have longer trip duration than female bikers do. I break the range for duration to two parts: one for larger than the mean time of trip duration and one for shorter than the mean. I am considreing to use the middle time which is 50% value instead of mean so that the data will look more evenly distributed. For assginment 3,it is just simply to plug in values and write down my conclusion with regard to my null hypothesis.
